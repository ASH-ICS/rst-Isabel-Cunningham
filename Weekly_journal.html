We tried thinking of many different ideas that were creative and new while staying true to ourselves. That is why we chose to do a home alone themed door, because its a movie we both love a lot. We didn't want it to just be about home alone so we needed another element for the door, that was when we came up with the idea to do a face in hole cutout. Ben and I spent a lot of time drawing, painting and cutting out many pieces for the door. Others helped with the tree, the paint can, the house, coloring, etc...</td>

The project was to create something, anything you wanted on CMU as long as it demonstrated your skills and what you learned through the course. I decided to go with a fishing simulator game because club penguin was on my mind and I was inspired by one of its mini games. I wasn't quite sure how to do every part of the game yet, but I was looking forward to figuring it out. </td>

It was fun seeing just how different everyones projects were and just how far we've come from the start of this course. At the beginning, none of us could even code a rectangle, and here we were making games. </td>

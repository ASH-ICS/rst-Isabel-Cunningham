      <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>A new level of 3D printing</b></h2>
      <img src="../image/miniBrain.png" alt="Mini Brain" style="width:150px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
      <p>3D printing has become incredibly advanced, to the point where you can print nearly anything: rockets, footwear, organs, and now mini brains. In Melbourne Australia, scientists at Monash University have printed living neural networks using rat brain cells that appear to have the ability to communicate just as real brains do.</p>
      <h3 style="padding-left: 80px;">Why?</h3>
      <p>You may wonder, why is this being created? The reason for this is partly to offer an alternative to animal testing, something that the US government is pushing scientists to reduce. Drug testing is incredibly important to ensure the safety of humans, however, with this high technology, in theory, they could use the mini-brains for their drug trials and studies of basic brain function.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">How?</h3>
      <p>3D printing is, however, not the only way to build a mini-brain. An existing option to build them is to grow and culture neurons in a petri dish, guiding its cells to grow around electrodes.</p> 
        
        <img src="../image/ew.png" alt="Test examples" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">

        
        <p>While this option is convenient for running experiments, it does not offer a lot of biological realism, it makes the brains flat instead of their true structure. A solution to this would be to coax several stem cells to rearrange themselves into 3D tissues known as organoids, allowing for them to be closer to the brain's actual structure but not fully able to control how they grow. Being faced with these two realities, the Monash team tried to incorporate both the 3D aspect and the biologically grown neurons into one to create a much more realistic mini-brain. Unlike your usual ink-infused 3D printers, the team used “bioink” (the rat brain cells suspended in a gel), to print the neural structures. After crosshatching layer by layer, a structure was created that gave the cells access to the gel’s nutrients in the bioink that mimicked the different sections in a brain's cortex. Adding astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia to the equation the mini brain could now communicate through its layers.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">The result?</h3>
      <p>As a result, the mini-brains acted as they were expected to be, making them valuable as long as they were functional. 
</p>

      <h3 style="text-align:center;">Not without difficulties.</h3>
      <img src="../image/neurons.jpg" alt="Neurons" style="width:150px;height:180px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
      <p>Not only is it difficult to not kill the cells when printing them due to the heating process when printing, but it is also incredibly important to not kill the electrical activity in the neurons. To be able to fully replicate how brains work while in their bodies, they need to keep their electrical activity. The whole process of printing and perfecting the mini-brains is slow, meaning that it is not yet capable of being applied to big pharmacies and companies. This does not mean that this is the end for the mini-brains, it just means that it will take time and effort. Aside from the actual technology required to create these brains not being perfected yet, convincing other Scientists to change their ways and reduce animal testing with this alternative will prove difficult. 
</p>
      <h3 style="text-align:center;">The future</h3>
      <p>The next steps for these brains are to see how they fare under stress and to understand to which extent they can regenerate. These results can help us discover important clues about the brain's ability to heal after trauma. Perhaps even someday, using this technology, people may be able to receive personalized treatments for brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases. </p>

         <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Using interactive 3D faces, eyewitness accuracy has been boosted!</b></h2>
         
         <p>In Canada, about 18 percent of those incarcerated never actually committed the crimes they are serving time for. Eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of these wrongful convictions. </p>

         <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the current technology used for identification? </h3>
          <img src="../image/3dface.jpg" alt="3d Face" style="width:250px;height:200px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
         <p>The current technology used is photo and video lineups. It provides many options of faces that look similar to find the right perpetrator. However, compared to a video and or photo lineup of potential suspects, a new study reveals that allowing witnesses to explore digital faces can significantly improve their identification accuracy. These interactive lineups allow them to view the faces from different angles and to actively explore and match faces to what they remember. </p>

          <h3 style="text-align:center;">The research </h3>
          <p>Researchers recruited 550 volunteers/witnesses split up randomly between the three different technologies to test their ability to make correct identifications. Some “witnesses” were shown images of the perpetrator and filler images, others were shown videos and lastly, some were shown via interactive lineups. The result? The researchers found that overall accuracy was around 27-75% improved when using interactive lineups instead of photo arrays and videos. </p>
         
         <h3 style="text-align:center;">How can this technology be integrated in the future? </h3>
         
         <img src="../image/justice.jpg" alt="Justicia" style="width:250px;height:200px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
  <p>By integrating this technology, there might be a dramatic reduction in misidentifications.  It will lead to more just outcomes in the criminal proceedings and investigations for the world and revolutionize how law enforcement conducts identification. This tech will be seen more in police procedures and will be further tested and adopted to prevent wrongful convictions.

         <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Blockchains, what is it?</b></h2>
        <img src="../image/blocks.jpg" alt="Blockchains" style="width:250px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
        <p>A blockchain, best known for their crucial role in cryptocurrency, is a distributed database/ledger that maintains a secure and growing lists of ordered records known as blocks. These blocks are linked together in a chain, these chains cannot be modified nor destroyed without the consent from the network.  It allows transparent transactions within a business network that creates ledgers for tracking payments, orders, and other transactions.  </p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>Blockchains create tamper-proof systems for recording transactions. This is crucial to allow for transactions to be done without the concern of many illegal issues that could occur between the two parties (the buyer and the seller). Unlike traditional database transactions, blockchains stop either or both parties from being untrustworthy sources when both of them have something to lose if they are lying. The blockchains, taking the role of a supervising third party, prevent them from corrupting the transaction due to the fear that they might both lose the entire transaction. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">How is it being used in technology and businesses?</h3>

    <p>Energy: Open transactions between businesses and peers allow for more business being done in renewable energy such as solar panels.</p>

        <p>Finance: Traditional banks and stock exchanges use blockchain technology to manage online accounts, payments, and market trading. </p>

        <p>Media and entertainment: To manage copyright data, companies in media and entertainment use blockchain systems.</p>
        
         <p>Retail: To track the movement of goods between buyers and suppliers, retail companies use blockchain. </p>

           <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>How generative AI could reshape gaming.</b></h2>
           <img src="../image/pacmyman.png" alt="Pac Man" style="width:200px;height:100px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
             
           <p>When thinking of AI, one generally thinks of new inventions such as Chat GPT, however, in reality AI has been used in video games as far as the 1950s. It was an essential part of giving the game adaptive characters and storylines in games such as Pacman with its ghosts. Now, with the rapid development of AI, game developers are seeing AI as an amazing opportunity for endless open worlds, unique content, autonomous characters, and even faster game development. </p>

           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Its role in Player Behavior Analysis (PBA)</b></h3>
           <img src="../image/goshower.jpg" alt="League of Legends" style="width:250px;height:150px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
          <p>AI is used to analyze player behavior, gameplay patterns and preferences to better personalize the gaming experience by perhaps changing its difficulty, providing recommendations and having more targeted ads. Some games that already use AI to provide more personalized gaming are league of legends and call of duty. Both of those games try to match players with those that are at similar levels for more interesting gameplay. </p>
           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Game development</b></h3>
          <p>Using AI during game development allows for more stable and secure softwares that will ensure that games run more smoothly and well polished. This will greatly shorten the time that it takes for game development which in turn may result in less of a need for those who could be programming the software. However, it could also mean that there will be more demand for video games and therefore more demand for help in that field. </p>
           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Graphics and Physics</b></h3>
          <p>AI-driven algorithms can largely ensure graphic rendering and physics quality in games. It enables developers to ultimately create immersing games with visually stunning and physically accurate worlds. </p>
          <p>Ultimately, AI will thoroughly change games, inside and out. Pushing the boundaries for what can be already done and allowing for new worlds to come into play. </p>

         <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>What is Bitcoin?</b></h2>
         <img src="../image/bitcoin.jpg" alt="Bitcoin" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
        <p>Bitcoin, also known as BTC, is the best known cryptocurrency, crypto meaning hidden/secret and currency meaning a form of money/exchange. This virtual currency is so big that blockchain technology, as it is today, was created to ensure safe and transparent exchanges without the need of a third party. </p>
         <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>A bit of history:</b></h3>
        <p>In January 2009, the first cryptocurrency (bitcoin) was introduced to the world. Since then, its market has been volatile and inconsistent. Ranging from being named the best investment of the year to being called the worst. The true creator(s) of bitcoin have remained anonymous to this day. However when launching it, they went by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. </p>
         <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>What does it mean to “mine” bitcoin?</b></h3>
        <img src="../image/mining.jpg" alt="Mining" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
        <p>Mining bitcoin is the process of generating a solution to validate information in a blockchain that will match a specific criteria. When the solution is correct, it rewards the “miner(s)” with bitcoin and fees for the work to whoever reached the solution first. </p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>How do people get money from bitcoin?</b></h3>
         <p>After mining for bitcoin, they can exchange it for currency via cryptocurrency exchanges with retailers and merchants that accept them. Both investors and speculators make money from buying and selling bitcoins. As of right now (3 November, 2023), a singular bitcoin is worth $47,123.81 CAD.</p>

           <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>A vulnerability that will affect the future.</b></h2>
           <img src="../image/Google.jpg" alt="Google" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
          <p>Major companies such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Cloudflare have revealed massive denial of service attacks were taken against their cloud infrastructure in the months of August and September.</p>
        
           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>What type of attacks were they?</b></h3>
        
          <p>The attacks that occurred have been DDoS attacks, meaning that the attacks use junk traffic to try and overwhelm a service. While not an uncommon type of attack from hackers, the attacks can be developed to be bigger and more effective. These hackers exploited a vulnerability in a foundational web protocol, meaning that while efforts to  fix the servers are in progress, the fixes will need to reach every web server before the attacks can be fully stopped.</p>
        
           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>The effects:</b></h3>
          <img src="../image/hacker.jpg" alt="Cyber attack" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
          <p>The effects were wide-ranging, including loss of business and unavailability. Seeing as the vulnerability stems from the internet protocol HTTP/2, any vendor that implemented the protocol will be susceptible to the attack.  </p>
          <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Why can it just be fixed like other bugs?
</b></h3>
           <p>Unlike simple bugs that can be patched by different companies, a flaw in a protocol cannot be fixed by one entity because each organization has its own web server that needs its own protection.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>What now?</b></h3>
                   <p>It will take years for the completion of the patching process and some servers will remain vulnerable, however the internet is safer now that the flaw has been shown.</p>

         <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>The first permanent electrified road for EVs.</b></h2                                                
      
        <p>After the landmark law passed by the EU to require all new cars sold to have zero CO2 emissions in 2035, European countries have been preparing the infrastructure required for this fossil fuel-free mobility. This therefore caused Sweden to create the first of its kind, permanent electrified highway road. This road will allow EVs to charge while driving! Furthermore, the dynamic charging will allow the EVs to travel longer distances with smaller batteries, and it saves the time that would be spent in charging stations. This project is set to be built by 2025.</p>
        <img src="../image/EV.jpg" alt="EV" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
         <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
        <p>At first this project had three types of charging that were being considered, such as:</p>
        <p>Catenary system - It would use overhead wires to provide electricity and would only be used for heavy-duty vehicles.</p>
        <p>Conductive system - This system works for both heavy-duty vehicles and private cars as long as a system such as a rail is used. The vehicles would be charged with a stick that touches the rail.</p>
        <p>Inductive system - This system uses special equipment buried underneath the road, it would then send electricity to a coil. The coil would receive the electricity and then use it to charge the battery. </p>
        <p>In the end, they decided to go with the conductive system.</p>
        
         <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>The holdbacks</b></h3>
        <img src="../image/Greenplanet.jpg" alt="Green Planet" style="width:200px;height:250px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
        <p>One of the biggest problems of making more and more roads electrified is that the cost would be rather expensive for it to be done. At the end of the day, it is still uncertain whether this technology will fully take off, however the search for more solutions for a greener planet is motivational alone.</p>

           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Television</b></h3>
          <p>To call it television would be old fashioned, however it would be the term used to encompass these large screens seen everywhere. It is display hardware that although incredibly cheap (to sell ensure that everyone can own one), would have many costs when it comes to subscriptions and services. 
</p>

           <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Phone</b></h3>
          <img src="../image/futuretech.jpg" alt="Future Tech" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
          <p>When thinking about a future phone, one might imagine something similar to our current smartphones, however in the future it is likely that it won’t be a phone at all. These “devices” would be embedded in our ears, a headset or our brain. The separation between us and our phones would wither away as we become more and more connected to our phones, in this sense, literally. Our minds would control these personalized gadgets to the point where it would become second nature to use them without even needing to take any physical actions. Visually, they could be presented as pocketable assistants powered by AI that transform into a palm-size touchscreen.</p>
        
          <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Health and Fitness Tracking</b></h3>
        <img src="../image/running.jpg" alt="Running" style="width:200px;height:150px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
           <p>All of these innovations might seem to lead the world closer and closer to what was imagined in the film Wall-e, however, its imagination may end up being far fetched. This can be seen in health and fitness tracking technology that will help us keep our health in the future. This can include following your favorite workout instructor while they are having digital sessions around the world, and workout tailored for your specific needs and goals. Phones and smartwatches will have sensors that accurately track blood pressure, health conditions, heart rate, etc…</p>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
            <p>While these are all speculations, it is incredibly interesting to note the current evolution of technology. It is only natural to wonder about the future and how different our lives can be even just 20 years from now.</p>

       <h2 style="text-align:center;"><b>Technology in fencing</b></h2>
       <img src="../image/fencing.jpg" alt="Fencing" style="width:200px;height:250px; float: right; padding-left: 10px;">
      <p>Fencing, the sport in which depending on the type of blade you have, you need to hit specific parts of your opponent's body. There are three types of blades for the sport, foil, epée, and sabre, foil being the most popular option. Nowadays, technology is commonly used in competitive fencing settings to indicate who scored first, and on if the hit was valid. This of course wasn’t always the case, and it only started to become incorporated in the sport by the 1930s.</p>

       <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>How is technology being used in this sport?
</b></h3>
      <img src="../image/fencingg.png" alt="Future fencing" style="width:200px;height:250px; float: left; padding-right: 10px;">
      <p>Foil and epee fencers score their points by thrusting their weapon to hit their opponent, there is therefore usually a tip at the end of the blade to record the hits. Using an electronic scoring machine, the touch of the blade sends a light when hit. There will be a specific light that sets off depending on the body part that gets hit. If the colour of the light is red or green, the score was valid, if it is white, then the hit was off-target. Other than at the point of the swords, the fencers also wear lamés (electronically-conductive jackets) that help record the points.</p>

       <h3 style="text-align:center;"><b>How helpful is this?</b></h3>
      <p>Instead of relying on 4 referees that supervise different angles during the game, the technology will accurately tell us whether a point was scored and or valid. Even with many referees, it can still be very difficult to know exactly what happened due to the speed of the game. At times it could even come down to relying on the integrity of the athletes.</p>
